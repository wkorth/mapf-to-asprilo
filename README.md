# asprilo-mapfConverter
A small python3-script for converting movingai's .map files to asprilo instances

mapfConvert.py takes a directory or file and a target directory as arguments. It works fine, but is not the most beautiful piece of code.

mapfConvert_2.0_WIP.py will be a more adaptable version of the script. It is currently WIP.
