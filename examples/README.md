# Examples

Two maps, "icecrown.map" from Warcraft 3, and "arena.map" from Dragon Age: Origins,
both pre- and post-conversion.

In this example, icecrown was converted from .map to .lp using

_$ python map2lp.py -i icecrown.map -o icecrown.lp_

Alternatively, the same result could be reached by using

_$ cat icecrown.map | python map2lp.py > icecrown.lp_

or a mix between the two.
